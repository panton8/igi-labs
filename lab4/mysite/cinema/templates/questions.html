  <p>The age limit law has been in effect since September 1, 2012, in accordance with international standards that protect children's rights to safety from information that causes them mental, physical and moral harm.

  <summary>Why and when does the cinema schedule change?</summary>
  <p>The bulk of films are released on the single launch day for films in Russia - Thursday, which is how the working week for cinemas starts - seven days, from Thursday to Wednesday. It is from Thursday that a new schedule will be formed.
It is worth noting that not all countries have the same opening day for films. In Russia, Germany, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, Italy it is Thursday, in the USA, Great Britain, South Korea, Spain it is Friday, in France it is Wednesday, and in Japan it is Saturday.
A single launch day within one country significantly simplifies the life of all participants in film viewing: cinemas, which are easier to schedule, and viewers, who know when to expect a new release.</p>
